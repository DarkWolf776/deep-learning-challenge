 Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to create a deep learning model using neural networks that can predict the success of funding applicants for a charitable organization.
By analyzing historical data on funding applicants, the goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify whether a new applicant
will be successful based on various input features.

Data Preprocessing:

Target variable(s): The target variable for the model is likely to be STATUS.
Feature variable(s): The features for the model would include various attributes of the funding applicants, such as application type, classification, and other relevant factors that may influence funding success.
Variables to be removed: Any variables that are neither targets nor features should be removed from the input data to avoid noise in the model also all Strings needed to be removed.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model (help from AI)  :

Neurons, layers, and activation functions: For the neural network model, I used 3 layers and a moderate amount of data to start

Achievement of target model performance: The success of the model depends on various factors, including the quality of the data, the model architecture, and the tuning of hyperparameters. 
Achieving the target model performance may require iterative experimentation and tuning.

Steps to increase model performance: To increase model performance, techniques such as adjusting the number of neurons and layers, optimizing hyperparameters, and using regularization techniques can be employed. 
Additionally, feature engineering, data augmentation, and exploring different model architectures could also be helpful.

In summary, the deep learning model developed for Alphabet Soup aims to predict the success of funding applicants based on historical data. 
The success of the model depends on various factors, and achieving the target performance required little experimentation and fine tuning.
A recommendation for exploring different types of models, such as gradient boosting machines or ensemble methods, which could provide insights and improve predictive performance. 
Additionally, conducting further analysis on feature importance and conducting sensitivity analysis could provide additional insights into the factors driving funding success.
